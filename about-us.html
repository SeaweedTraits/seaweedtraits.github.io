          <h3>Alizée Mauffrey</h3>
          <p>I am pursuing a fully-funded PhD at Swansea University, UK thanks to a College of Science Scholarship from Swansea University and a Marie Curie Career Integration Grant to J.N. Griffin. I graduated from a Master of Research in Biosciences and a Bachelor of Science (First Class Hons.) in Marine Biology at Swansea University. My overarching aim is to further develop the field of macroalgal functional ecology by adapting some fundamental concepts of plant functional ecology, like the plant economics spectrum, to macroalgae. My work is driven by a love of the marine realm that was sparked from family travels around the world from a very young age and by the desire to better understand the role that primary producers play in coastal ecosystems.</p>

          <h3>Laura Cappelatti</h3>
          <p>I have just completed my PhD in Biology at Swansea University, where my work focused on functional ecology of British seaweed. My Bachelor and Masters degree were obtained in Brazil, my home country, where I focused on the ecology of tropical terrestrial plants. Today, I have a broad interest in the community ecology of primary producers (both terrestrial and marine), with a special curiosity about functional diversity.</p>
